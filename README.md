Created a simple calculator app that has the 4 basic arithmetic modes (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division) and 1 additional mode to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

This was a practice project which enabled the use of:
* Float
* Int
* If / Elif / Else statements
* Methods, particularly .lower()

Improvements to be made: 
Currently the program doesn't alert if the user input an invalid number or give the user the option to restart a new calculation
